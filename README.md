# A Sample of API-Authentication

This code appears to be a test suite written using Cypress, a popular JavaScript end-to-end testing framework for web applications. The test suite consists of three test cases, each testing a different type of authentication method:

Basic Authentication:

It sends a GET request to url with basic authentication credentials (username: postman, password: password).
It expects the response status to be 200 and the response body to contain the property authenticated set to true.
Digest Authentication:

It sends a GET request to the same URL but with digest authentication.
It expects the response status to be 200 and the response body to contain the property authenticated set to true.
API Key Authentication:

It sends a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API endpoint with an API key provided as a query parameter.
It expects the response status to be 200.
